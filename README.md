# Shabbos Times Discord Bot

![](https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shabbos-696x465.jpg)

This bot was inspired from the [Hagaon Hamachane Bot by Acher](https://github.com/Acher224/HaGaonHaMachane-py). The purpose of this bot is to allow users to get this week's Parsha, candlelighting and Havdalah times with a single request. Essentially the bot communicates with the [HebCal Shabbat times REST API](https://www.hebcal.com/home/197/shabbat-times-rest-api) and pulls from the JSON there.

The following commands will all get the candlelighting times for this week:

* `!ShabbosTimes [city]`
* `!shabbostimes [city]`
* `!ShabbatTimes [city]`
* `!shabbattimes [city]`

To see the list of the availible cities that this can retrieve times for write `!cities`
